## Prerequisites

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```
Please make sure that Node.js (version >= 16) is installed on your operating system.


# Installation

### Angular
1. To install the `Angular CLI`, open a terminal window and run the following command:

    ```sh
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```
2. Install npm packages by using `npm CLI`

    ```sh
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

3. Run for a dev server
    ```sh
    ng serve
    ```
    Navigate to http://localhost:4200/

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
